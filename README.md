## Overview

For project #2, I made a site that allows you to enter information about job applications the user has submitted.

When a user goes to the site, they are prompted to sign up or log in.

They are then directed to the home page which will allow them to add new applications.

Once they submit the applications information they will then see that information displayed on the home page.

On the home page they are given the option to edit, delete, and view more details about the submitted application.


## Technologies Used:
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Future Development:
- Add ability to filter and search through applications
- Keep track of how many applications have been sent
- Ability for user to edit the labels for the forms
